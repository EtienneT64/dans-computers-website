# Dans Computers e-commerce Website Project

## My first fullstack website created using PHP and MySQL

Dans Computers is an e-commerce website for computer parts. It was built without
using any frameworks, libraries, and CMS. It is database driven and has an admin
account that can perform CRUD operations on the database. The e-commerce
features are conceptual and not real. The website allows the user to do the
following:

- View the Home page to see a selection of products
- Sign Up with an account
- Login to be able to add items to one's cart
- View Sales page to see all available products
- View Account page to see account details
- Add items to Cart and checkout to clear cart
